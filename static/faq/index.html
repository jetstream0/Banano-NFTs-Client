		    <h1 class="style1">Frequently Asked Questions about Banano NFTs</h1>
	        <h2 class="style1">Are the NFTs on the Banano blockchain?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">Yup! Not wax or ethereum. It is on the Banano blockchain (or technically, block lattice).</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">But Banano doesn't have smart contracts. How is this possible?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">Great question! Normally NFTs are made using smart contracts. But of course, Banano doesn't support smart contracts, so instead Airtune developed a meta protocol. Learn more about the meta protocol <a href="" target="_blank" style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">How do I see Banano NFTs?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">You can do that <a href="https://bannfts.prussiafan.club"  target="_blank" style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong>right here!</strong></a>. You can't see them in Kalium or other wallets yet, but in the future, some wallets and block explorers will likely support seeing Banano NFTs. The NFT images themselves are stored on IPFS (which is also where many ETH NFTs are stored in) but all the NFT minting, sending, and more happens on chain.</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">Should I use tipbot/exchange wallets to store NFTs?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">No. Please only use a banano address you own the seed to.</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">How do I send Banano NFTs?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">Go to your account page on this site, and look for the NFT you want to send. Click "Send Me", and follow the instructions. Make sure to change the rep back afterwards!</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">How do I mint Banano NFTs?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">You can do that <a href="https://bannfts.prussiafan.club/mint" target="_blank" style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong>here</strong></a>. It is a bit tricky right now though, so please contact me (Prussia) if you need help on discord, reddit, or matrix.</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">Does minting/sending/etc Banano NFTs cost anything?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">Nope! Everything is free.</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">Can I sell the NFTs?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">Not yet. You can make p2p trades at your own risk, but atomic swaps are currently not implemented anywhere.</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">Will CryptoMonkeys migrate to Banano chain NFTs?</h2>
		    <p class="style1">From the words of Soggy herself:</p>
		    <p class="style1">"WAX has been and will continue to be home for cryptomonKeys and there are currently no plans to change that. Of course, there have been talks about what place we will have in the BANANO NFT space. Since the infrastructure for BANANO NFTs has not yet matured enough to handle all the many operations of cryptomonKeys, we are keeping a close watch for what/where our place will be."</p>
		    <p class="style1">In other words, probably, but only after the infrastructure for Banano NFTs grows.</p>
		    <h2 class="style1">I can't see my NFTs.</h2>
		    <p class="style1">Here's a quick checklist:</p>
		  </blockquote>
		  <ul class="style1">
            <li>Are you sure you have any NFTs? Maybe you don't.</li>
            <li>Check for pending transactions. If you have any, receive them.</li>
            <li>Did you register for a NFT giveaway? Often times, the NFTs are not sent until after the giveaway/event ends, so be patient.</li>
            <li>Were the NFTs received more than 120 transactions ago? In that case, due to API limitations the site does not display them by default. Add a ?offset=anumberhere to the end of the url and see if they show up. One suggestion is to send the NFTs out from your main address to a new address Most Banano wallets, like Kalium, allow you to generate multiple addresses under the same seed, so try that.</li>
            <h2>How do the giveaways work?</h2>
            <p>Send the requested amount to the burn address, and <b>after the event</b>, the NFTs will be sent to the account you sent to the burn address with.</p>
